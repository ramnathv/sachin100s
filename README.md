## 100 Centuries of Sachin Tendulkar

![sachin](http://tamil.theunrealtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sachin.jpg)

Sachin Tendulkar is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest cricketers the world has seen. This is a timeline of his 100 centuries, created using rCharts and TimelineJS.

This timeline chart is fully reproducible using the code [here](code.R). You will need to have the `dev` version of rCharts installed to make this work.

```coffee
require(devtools)
install_github('rCharts', 'ramnathv', ref = 'dev')
```

If you have any feedback/suggestions post them [here](https://github.com/ramnathv/sachin100s/issues/new)

#### Bugs

1. For ODIs, the video links seem to be incorrectly arranged. I assumed the links were correct, but would have to do some more work to synchronize everything.
